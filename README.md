# SpotifyQueue
Individual project I choose to persue becuase I wanted to explore interacting with APIs and my enjoyment for music made this a good first choice.

Written in Python, using Spotify's web API and the requests library.

You will have to generate a personal Authenticator token. You can do so here https://developer.spotify.com/console/post-queue/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A4iV5W9uYEdYUVa79Axb7Rh&device_id=

Set the variable SPOTIFY_AUTH_TOKEN to your generated token and make sure to interact with your account prior to see the program in action.
